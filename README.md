# Battleship Game
This is a simple implementation of the Battleship game in Java. It allows you to play a text-based version of Battleship, 
trying to sink enemy ships by guessing their locations on a grid.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Run the MyBattleshipAdventure.java file to start the game.

# How to Play
1. When the game starts, you'll see instructions on how to enter your guesses.
2. Guess locations using coordinates in the format (letter)(number), e.g., a1, b3, etc.

3. Try to sink all the enemy ships by guessing their locations correctly.

4. The game will display messages indicating whether your guesses are hits, misses, or if you've sunk a ship.

5. Keep guessing until you've sunk all the enemy ships.
# Customization
Feel free to customize the game by modifying the code. You can change ship names, grid size, the number of ships, and more.

# Code Structure
The code is organized into three classes:

1. MyBattleshipAdventure: The main class that sets up the game, handles user input, and controls the flow of the game.
2. Battleship: Represents the Battleship objects, their names, locations, and hit tracking.
3. GameHelper: A utility class to assist with user input and managing battleship placement.
